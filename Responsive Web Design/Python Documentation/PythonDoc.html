                    Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability.
                    It is versatile and can be used for various purposes, including web development, data analysis,
                    artificial intelligence, and automation.

                <p>
                    Python comes with a comprehensive standard library and supports multiple programming paradigms,
                    including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming.

                <p>
                    Python shares similarities with other programming languages but also has distinct differences.
                    Unlike statically-typed languages such as Java or C++, Python is dynamically typed, meaning
                    variable types are determined at runtime rather than compile time.
                </p>
    
                <p>
                    Python is renowned for its simplicity and readability, which sets it apart from languages like
                    JavaScript and Java. While JavaScript shares some syntax similarities with Python, Python's
                    syntax is often considered more intuitive and easier to grasp for beginners.
                </p>
    
                <p>
                    Additionally, Python emphasizes readability and simplicity over performance, making it a preferred
                    choice for rapid prototyping and development, whereas languages like Java prioritize performance
                    and scalability.

            <article>
                To get started with writing Python, open a text editor and write your first "Hello world" Python code:
    
                <code>print("Hello, world!")</code>

            <article>
                <p>
                    Variables in Python are used to store data values. Unlike some other languages, Python does not require
                    explicit declaration of variables. A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Python variables can store data of different types, including numbers, strings, lists, tuples, and dictionaries.

                <p>Python supports various data types, including:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Integer</li>
                    <li>Float</li>
                    <li>String</li>

                </ul>

Waiting:Each .nav-link should have text that corresponds to the header text of its related section (e.g. if you have a "Hello world" section/header, your #navbar should have a .nav-link which has the text "Hello world").
Waiting:Each .nav-link should have an href attribute that links to its corresponding .main-section (e.g. If you click on a .nav-link element that contains the text "Hello world", the page navigates to a section element with that id).
Waiting:Your #navbar should always be on the left edge of the window.
Waiting:Your Technical Documentation project should use at least one media query.
You can see a main element with a corresponding id="main-doc", which contains the page's main content (technical documentation)
Within the #main-doc element, you can see several section elements, each with a class of main-section. There should be a minimum of five
The first element within each .main-section should be a header element, which contains text that describes the topic of that section.
Each section element with the class of main-section should also have an id that corresponds with the text of each header contained within it. Any spaces should be replaced with underscores (e.g. The section that contains the header "JavaScript and Java" should have a corresponding id="JavaScript_and_Java")
The .main-section elements should contain at least ten p elements total (not each)
The .main-section elements should contain at least five code elements total (not each)
The .main-section elements should contain at least five li items total (not each)
You can see a nav element with a corresponding id="navbar"
The navbar element should contain one header element which contains text that describes the topic of the technical documentation
Additionally, the navbar should contain link (a) elements with the class of nav-link. There should be one for every element with the class main-section
The header element in the #navbar must come before any link (a) elements in the navbar
Each element with the class of nav-link should contain text that corresponds to the header text within each section (e.g. if you have a "Hello world" section/header, your navbar should have an element which contains the text "Hello world")
When you click on a navbar element, the page should navigate to the corresponding section of the #main-doc element (e.g. If you click on a .nav-link element that contains the text "Hello world", the page navigates to a section element with that id, and contains the corresponding header)
On regular sized devices (laptops, desktops), the element with id="navbar" should be shown on the left side of the screen and should always be visible to the user
Your technical documentation should use at least one media query
Fulfill the user stories and pass all the tests below to complete this project. Give it your own personal style. Happy Coding!
You should have a main element with an id of main-doc.
